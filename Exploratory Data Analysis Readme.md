**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Cloth Sales during Diwali across India**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in a Jupyter Notebook to investigate the sales patterns of clothing items during the Diwali festival across India. The analysis aims to uncover key insights into consumer behaviour, regional sales trends, and the factors influencing sales during this festive period. The findings will help retailers and marketers optimize their strategies for future Diwali seasons.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Sales Trend Analysis:** Examine sales patterns of clothing items during Diwali across different regions of India.
1. **Customer Behavior:** Analyze purchasing behaviours, including the types of clothing items most popular during Diwali.
1. **Regional Insights:** Identify regional variations in clothing sales, focusing on high-performing states and cities.
1. **Seasonal Impact:** Understand the influence of the Diwali season on clothing sales compared to other times of the year.
1. **Revenue Insights:** Assess the overall revenue generated during the Diwali period and identify the top revenue-generating products.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis includes sales records from various retail outlets and online platforms across India. Key data fields include:

- **Transaction Details:** Order IDs, timestamps, and sales values
- **Product Information:** Categories, types, and prices of clothing items sold
- **Customer Data:** Demographics such as age, gender, location, and purchase history
- **Sales Channels:** Information on whether the purchase was made in-store or online
- **Geographical Data:** State, city, and regional identifiers for sales locations

**Key Analysis Techniques**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  - Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization to ensure accuracy in analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculation of measures such as mean, median, and mode to summarize sales data
  - **Visualizations:**
  - Use of bar charts, line graphs, box plots, and histograms to visualize sales trends and distributions
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Identifying relationships between different variables, such as product type and sales volume
- **Regional Analysis:**
  - Heatmaps and geographical plots to visualize regional sales performance during Diwali
- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Analyzing sales trends over time to identify peak periods during the Diwali season

**Tools and Libraries**

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The development environment used to write and document the code
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization
- **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations
- **Geopandas:** For geographical plotting and regional analysis

**Project Learnings**

- Performed data cleaning and manipulation
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries
- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender and age groups.
- Improved sales by identifying the most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.

**Conclusion**

This project provides an in-depth exploratory analysis of cloth sales during the Diwali season across India. The insights derived will help retailers and marketers better understand consumer behaviour, optimize inventory, and improve marketing strategies for future festive periods.
